[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mitch-b/whoisit-android.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mitch-b/whoisit-android)

Android application to modify Ringtone based on which number is calling.

Getting Started
--------------

Built with [IntelliJ IDEA 13](http://jetbrains.com/idea/).

Open IntelliJ IDEA (or Android Studio), choose 'Open Project', and navigate to this cloned repo.

This project also uses:

- [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) builds.
- Android minSdkVersion 8
- Android targetSdkVersion 18
- Android Build Tools 19

If you have gradle installed, and your Android SDKs downloaded, you should be able to build & run the application either on a connected USB device, or the emulator (untested).


Android Bootstrap
--------------
This application is using an alpha stream of [Android Bootstrap](http://androidbootstrap.com), and with that comes an initial login screen.

Use:
- demo@androidbootstrap.com
- android

Not that logging in is essential to making the app work, because I've made no UI adjustments from the initial load.

Issues?
--------------
Please submit any issues in Github's [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/mitch-b/whoisit-android/issues).
